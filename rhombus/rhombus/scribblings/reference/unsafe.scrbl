 When included by a module, causes the module to be compiled in unsafe
 mode, which may skip annotation checks on primitive operation to
 potentially improve performance. If a skipped check would have failed,
 however, the resulting behavior is unspecified and may lead to a crash
 or unpredictable behavior either immediately or at an arbitrarily later
 time.
