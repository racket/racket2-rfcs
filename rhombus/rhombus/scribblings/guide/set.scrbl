When @braces is used with elements that do not
have @colon to separate a key and value, then @braces creates a set. (If
a set-element expression uses @colon, then it will need to be in
parentheses to avoid being parsed as a keyâ€“value pair.) A set
supports @tech(~doc: ref_doc){membership tests} with the @rhombus(in) operator.
There's a @rhombus(Set) constructor that's analogous to
@rhombus(Map), but @rhombus(Set) accepts just values to include in the
set. The @rhombus(++) operator effectively unions sets.

@examples(
  ~eval: set_eval
  ~defn:
    def friends = {"alice", "bob", "carol"}
  ~repl:
    if "alice" in friends && "carol" in friends
    | "I know both"
    | "Who are they?"
  ~defn:
    def new_friends = friends ++ {"david"}
  ~repl:
    "david" in new_friends
    "david" in friends
)

Using @rhombus(Set) explicitly before @braces
disables the special treatment of @colon to indicate a map, and
each element within @braces is simply an
expression. The @rhombus(Set) constructor can also be used like a
function with @parens instead of
@braces.

@rhombus(Set.of, ~annot) and @rhombus(MutableSet) work as you'd expect. When
@brackets with @rhombus(:=) is used to modify a mutable
set, the index is removed from the set if the assigned value is
@rhombus(#false), otherwise the index is added to the set.

Within a set construction using @braces, a
@rhombus(&) form splice a set into the constructed set, analogous to the
way @rhombus(&) works for list constructions.

@examples(
  ~eval: set_eval
  {"dennis", & friends}
)

Also similar to maps, a repetition can be used to construct a set.

@examples(
  ~defn:
    def [elem, ...] = ["a", "b", "a", "c", "c"]
  ~repl:
    {elem, ...}
)

Set forms work as bindings, too, analogous to map binding forms.

@examples(
  ~eval: set_eval
  ~defn:
    def {"carol", other_friend, ...} = friends
  ~repl:
    [other_friend, ...]
)
