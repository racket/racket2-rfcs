@title(~tag: "subclass"){Subclasses}

In a @rhombus(class) body, @rhombus(extends, ~class_clause) followed by
the name of an existing class. Instances of the new class, the
@emph{subclass}, will also count as instances of the existing class, the
@emph{superclass}. Since that creates obligations on the superclass,
however, a class is @emph{final} by default, which means that it does
not permit subclasses.

@examples(
  ~defn:
    class Posn(x, y)
  ~defn:
    ~error:
      class Posn3D(z):
        extends Posn
)

To allow subclasses, add a @rhombus(nonfinal, ~class_clause) clause in a
class:

@examples(
  ~eval: subclass_eval
  ~defn:
    class Posn(x, y):
      nonfinal
  ~defn:
    class Posn3D(z):
      extends Posn
)

When a subclass is created, superclass fields are implicitly
included before new fields in the subclass's constructor:

@examples(
  ~eval: subclass_eval
  ~repl:
    def p = Posn3D(1, 2, 3)
    p
    p.y
    p is_a Posn
    p is_a Posn3D
)

The @rhombus(interface) definition form is similar to @rhombus(class),
but without fields. A @rhombus(class) form can declare that the class
implements an interface through an @rhombus(implements, ~class_clause)
clause. When a class implements an interface, then instances of the
class satisfy the interface annotation, similar to the way that a
subclass instances satisfies the superclass annotation. A class can have
at most one superclass. but it can implement any number of interfaces.
An interface is never final, so no @rhombus(nonfinal, ~class_clause) is
needed in an interface.

@examples(
  ~defn:
    interface Shape
    interface Dance
    class Square(side):
      implements:
        Shape
        Dance
  ~repl:
    def s = Square(10)
    s is_a Shape
    s is_a Dance
)
