 Binds @rhombus(op_or_id_path) as a operator, either
 prefix, infix, postfix, or a combination.

 The operator is function-like in the sense that it receives argument
 values. (To bind an operator that is not function-like, see
 @rhombus(macro) or @rhombus(expr.macro, ~expr).) Each argument is specified by
 a binding that must be written as a single shrubbery term that is not an
 operator in the shrubbery sense; parentheses can be used around other
 binding forms for arguments. If two identifier terms appear within the
 parentheses that follow @rhombus(operator), a prefix operator is
 defined using the first identifier as its name. When a parenthesized
 sequence is followed by @rhombus(::, ~bind) or @rhombus(:~, ~bind), it
 is treated as starting a @rhombus(maybe_res_annot), which is the same
 as in @rhombus(fun) definitions.

 The new operator is also bound a @tech{repetition} operator, in which
 case its arguments must be repetitions. The depth of the resulting
 repetition is the maximum of the argument repetition depths.

 When multple cases are provided via @vbar, an operator can be defined
 as both prefix and infix or prefix and postfix (but not infix and
 postfix). The prefix cases and infix/postfix cases can be mixed in any
 order, but when the operator is used as a prefix or infix/postfix
 operator, cases are tried in the relative order that they are written.
 Similar to the @rhombus(fun) form the operator name and a result
 annotation can be written before the @vbar cases to appply for all cases.

 At the start of an operator body, @rhombus(option)s can declare
 precedence and, in the case of an infix operator, an associativity for
 the operator. Each @rhombus(option) keyword can appear at most once. In
 a precedence specification, @rhombus(~other) stands for any operator not
 otherwise mentioned. When multiple cases are povided using an immediate @vbar, then
 only the first prefix case and the first infix/postfix case can supply
 options; alternatively, when the operator name (maybe with a result annotation)
 is written before @vbar, options that apply to all cases can be supplied in
 a block before the cases. Options can appear both before the cases and in
 individual clauses, as long as all precedence and all associatvity
 options are in one or the other.
