@section{Name Roots}

@defmodule[enforest/name-root]

@defproc[(name-root [proc procedure?])
         name-root?]{

 Returns an implementation of @racket[prop:name-root] with a function
 that results in the structure instance itself.

 The transformer procedure @racket[proc] takes an introducer function
 and a syntax list of terms and returns two values: a new head
 identifier or operator, and a syntax list of remaining terms. The
 introducer function corresponds to the space that is otherwise used
 to lookup identifiers, which the transformer procedure might take
 into account.

}

@defproc[(name-root-proc [v any/c])
         procedure?]{

 Extracts the transformer procedure from @racket[v], which must be an
 instance of @racket[name-root].

}

@defthing[prop:name-root struct-type-property?]{

 A structure type property whose value must be a function that takes a
 structure implementing the property and returns an instance of
 @racket[name-root].

}

@defproc[(name-root? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{

 Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] implements @racket[prop:name-root],
 @racket[#f] otherwise.

}

@defproc[(name-root-ref [v any/c])
         any/c]{

 Returns an instance of @racket[name-root] if @racket[v] implements
 @racket[prop:name-root], @racket[#f] otherwise.

                      [protocol (or/c 'macro 'automatic)]
                      [proc procedure?])
            #:omit-constructor]{

 The @racket[name] identifier is the name of the operator.

 The @racket[precs] list is an association list from identifiers to
 @racket['stronger], @racket['weaker], @racket['same],
 @racket['same-on-left], or @racket['same-on-right], indicating that
 the operator's precedence is stronger than, weaker than, or the same
 as (when on the indicated side of) the associated identifier;
 @racket['default] can be used instead of an identifier to specify a
 default relationship.

 The @racket[protocol] is either @racket['macro] for
 @tech{macro protocol} or @racket['auto] for
 @tech{automatic protocol}.

 The @racket[proc] transformer procedure depends on the mode (prefix
 or infix) as well as the @racket[protocol] for its arguments and
 results.

 This structure type should not be used directly. Instead, use its
 subtypes @racket[prefix-operator] and @racket[infix-operator].

}

@defstruct*[(prefix-operator operator) ()]{

 If the @racket[protocol] is @racket['macro], @racket[proc] takes a
 syntax list of terms consisting of all remaining terms (including the
 operator term) in the enclosing group and returns two values: a
 parsed form, and a syntax list of remaining terms.

 If the @racket[protocol] is @racket['auto], @racket[proc] takes two
 arguments: a parsed right-hand form and the operator name, and
 returns a further parsed form.

}

@defproc[(prefix-operator-ref [v any/c])
         any/c]{

 Returns @racket[v] if it is an instance of @racket[prefix-operator],
 @racket[#f] otherwise.

}

@defstruct*[(infix-operator operator) ([assoc (or/c 'left 'right 'none)])]{

 The @racket[assoc] is either @racket['left] for left-associativity,
 @racket['right] for right-associativity, or @racket['none] for
 non-associativity.

 If the @racket[protocol] is @racket['macro], @racket[proc] takes two
 arguments: a parsed left-hand form and a syntax list of terms
 consisting of all remaining terms (including the operator term) in
 the enclosing group, and returns two values: a parsed form, and a
 syntax list of remaining terms.

 If the @racket[protocol] is @racket['auto], @racket[proc] takes three
 arguments: a parsed left-hand form, a parsed right-hand form, and the
 operator name, and returns a further parsed form.

}

@defproc[(infix-operator-ref [v any/c])
         any/c]{

 Returns @racket[v] if it is an instance of @racket[infix-operator],
 @racket[#f] otherwise.

 The @racket[enforest] name (defaulting to a fresh name) is bound to
 an enforest function, which is used to start enforestation of a
 group. It takes a syntax list of S-expressions for parsed shrubberies
 in a group and returns a parsed form. The enforest function drives a
 loop that calls the enforest-step function.

 The @racket[enforest-step] name (defaulting to a fresh name) is bound
 to an enforest-step function that continues an enforestation. It
 takes two arguments: a syntax list of all remaining terms in a group
 and the current operator, and returns two values: a parsed form and a
 syntax list of remaining terms (starting with an infix operator that
 has lower precedence than the input operator).

 The @racket[syntax-class] is a name (defaulting to a fresh name) or a
 parenthesized name with arguments. The name is bound to a syntax
 class (see @racket[define-syntax-class]) that matches and enforests a
 @racket[group] shrubbery representation, and an error is reported if
 a match is attempted but fails. A match has a @racket[parsed]
 attribute for the enforestation result. If @racket[syntax-class] is a
 parenthesized name with arguments, then each argument is also passed
 along to a prefix or infix operator after all other arguments (which
 vary, depending on the protocol).

 The @racket[relative-precedence] name, if present, is bound to a
 function that compares the precedence of two operators. The function
 takes four arguments: @racket['infix] or @racket['prefix] for the
 left operator's mode, the left operator's identifier, @racket['infix]
 or @racket['prefix] for the right operator's mode, and the right
 operator's identifier. The result is either @racket['stronger] (left
 takes precedence), @racket['weaker] (right takes precedence), or an
 error result: @racket[#f] (no precedence relation),
 @racket['inconsistent-prec] (inconsistent precedence),
 @racket['inconsistent-assoc] (inconsistent associativity),
 @racket['same] (same precedence but non-associativity),
 @racket['same-on-left] (same precedence but on the wrong side),
 @racket['unbound] (one of the operators is unbound).

 The @racket[prefix-more-syntax-class] and
 @racket[infix-more-syntax-class] names (defaulting to fresh names)
 are bound to syntax classes that take an operator-name argument, and
 match and enforest a group that's intended to represent the tail of a
 group. The enforestation is based on the precedence and associatvity
 of the given operator. A match has a @racket[parsed] attribute for
 the enforestation result and a @racket[tail] attribute for the
 remaining terms in a group. If @racket[syntax-class] is a
 parenthesized name with arguments, then
 @racket[prefix-more-syntax-class] and
 @racket[infix-more-syntax-class] accept those additional arguments,
 too, after the operator-name argument.

 The @racket[desc] (defaulting to @racket["form"]) and
 @racket[operator-desc] (defaulting to @racket["operator"]) strings
 are used in error reporting to refer to a form or an operator for a
 form.

 The @racket[parsed-tag] value, which typically a quoted symbol or a
 keyword, is recognized in a @racket['parsed] form to detect
 already-parsed forms that are not enforested further.

 The @racket[in-space] function (defaulting to the identity function)
 takes an identifier syntax object and adds a space scope if the
 enforesting context uses a space.

 The @racket[prefix-operator-ref] (defaulting to
 @prefix-operator-ref/default) and @racket[infix-operator-ref]
 (defaulting to @infix-operator-ref/default) functions take a
 compile-time value and extract an instance of
 @racket[prefix-operator] or @racket[infix-operator], respectively, if
 the value has one suitable for the context, returning @racket[#f]
 otherwise. Normally, these functions use structure-property
 accessors.

 The @racket[name-path-op] symbol (defaulting to @racket['|.|]) is an
 operator name that is (symbolically) recognized after a name-root
 identifier for hierarchical name references.

 The @racket[name-root-ref] function (defaulting to
 @name-root-ref/default) takes a compile-time value and extracts an
 instance of @racket[name-root]. The compile-time value is resolved
 from an identifier that is followed by an operator recognized by
 @racket[name-path-op].

 The @racket[in-name-root-space] function is analogous to
 @racket[in-space], but applied to an identifier before searching for
 a name resolver using @racket[name-root-ref].

 The @racket[check-result] function (defaulting to a function that
 checks whether its first argument is a syntax object, returning it
 as-is if so, raising an exception otherwise) takes an enforestation
 result and checks whether the result is suitable for the context. It
 should either raise an exception for earlier detection of errors or
 return its first argument (possibly adjusted). A second argument to
 the function is the procedure that produced the result, which can be
 used for error reporting (e.g., through @racket[object-name]). If
 @racket[syntax-class] is a parenthesized name with arguments, then
 @racket[check-result] receives those arguments, too, after all
 others.

 The @racket[make-identifier-form] function (defaulting to the
 identity function) takes an identifier an produces a suitable parsed
 form. If a context does not have a meaning for unbound identifiers, a
 syntax error can be reported. If @racket[syntax-class] is a
 parenthesized name with arguments, then @racket[make-identifier-form]
 receives those arguments, too, after all others.

 The @racket[make-operator-form] function, if non-@racket[#f], takes
 an operator and produces a suitable parsed form. Absence or
 @racket[#f] means that an error is reported for an unbound operator
 in an expression position.

 The @racket[juxtapose-implicit-name] symbol (defaulting to
 @racket['#%juxtapose] as described in @secref["implicit-ops"]) is the
 name for the implicit infix operator between two immediately adjacent
 expressions.

 The @racket[select-implicit-prefix] function (defaulting to a
 function that selects implicit prefix operators as described in
 @secref["implicit-ops"]) takes a term within a group that is not an
 operator and does not follow an infix operator. The result should be
 two values: a symbol as the name for the implicit prefix operator and
 a syntax object whose lexical context is added to the symbol to look
 up the operator binding.

 The @racket[select-implicit-infix] function (defaulting to a
 function that selects implicit infix operators as described in
 @secref["implicit-ops"]) takes a term within a group that is not an
 operator and follows a parsed term. The result should be two values:
 a symbol as the name for the implicit infix operator and a syntax
 object whose lexical context is added to the symbol to look up the
 operator binding.

 The @racket[track-origin] function is used to track expansion via
 prefix and infix operators. It defaults to
 @racket[syntax-track-origin].

 The @racket[use-site-scopes?] value configures whether expansion
 process via prefix and infix operators should introduce use-site
 scopes. See also @racket[syntax-local-apply-transformer]. The default
 is @racket[#f] to @emph{not} introduce use-site scopes.

 The @racket[lookup-space-description] function is used when reporting
 a syntax error due to an unbound identifier or operator. The function
 is called with a symbol representing an interned scope, and if the
 result is not @racket[#f], it is used as a description of the binding
 space. The default always returns @racket[#f].

@section{Prefix Transformers}

@defmodule[enforest/transformer]

@defstruct*[transformer ([proc procedure?])]{

 The @racket[syntax-class] is a name (defaulting to a fresh name) or a
 parenthesized name with arguments. The name is bound to a syntax
 class that matches and parses a @racket[group] shrubbery
 representation, but unlike a syntax class introduced with
 @racket[define-enforest], the match can fail without triggering an
 error. A match has a @racket[parsed] attribute for the parsed result.
 If @racket[syntax-class] is a parenthesized name with arguments, then
 each argument is also passed along to a transformer after the syntax
 argument.

 The @racket[desc] string (defaulting to @racket["form"]) is used in
 error reporting to refer to a form.

 The @racket[transformer-ref] function (defaulting to
 @transformer-ref/default) takes a compile-time value and extracts an
 instance of @racket[transformer], if the value has one suitable for
 the context, returning @racket[#f] otherwise. Normally, this function
 uses a structure-property accessor.

 If @racket[transform] is not @racket[#f], it is bound to a function
 that takes syntax and parses it using @racket[syntax-class]. The
 default is @racket[#f].

 If @racket[predicate] is not @racket[#f], it is bound to a function
 that takes syntax and reports whether the form starts with an
 identifier that is bound as a transformer. The default is
 @racket[#f].

 See @racket[define-enforest] for the meanings of @racket[desc],
 @racket[name-path-op], @racket[name-root-ref], @racket[in-name-root-space],
 @racket[check-result], @racket[track-origin], and @racket[use-site-scopes?].
