;; Source locations and 'raw properties for shrubbery forms as syntax
;; objects:
;;
;;  * `group` and `multi` aren't expected to have source locations;
;;    ideally, they have 'raw as "", but don't rely on that; the
;;    S-expression parentheses around `group` from the Shrubbery
;;    reader will have a spanning srcloc, but not from a Rhombus-level
;;    template construction, so don't rely on that, either
;;
;;  * `parens` and similar (including `block`) are expected to have a
;;    source location that spans the content; they have 'raw,
;;    'raw-suffix, etc.; the reader copies that source location to
;;    surrounding parentheses, but a Rhombus template construction
;;    doesn't
;;
;;  * `op` from the reader has the same source location as its symbol,
;;    but don't rely on that; as usual, the reader also copies to the
;;    surroudning paranetheses, but don't rely on that
;;
;;  * `alts` is like `group`: it isn't expected to have a source
;;    location, although the shrubbery reader will associate a
;;    spanning source location to surrounding parentheses
;;
;; "Respan" on a shrubbery representation means to give a syntax object
;; (i.e., the immediate wrapper) a source location that corresponds to
;; the content. That may involve moving out a `parens`, etc., tag or
;; walking through a `group` content to create a source location that
;; spans all the content, for example. A "respan" operation makes
;; sense for a group or unwrapped term sequence, since the span can be
;; reconstructed if the immediate wrapper is lost; attaching
;; information to the wrapper can act as a kind of cache. A computed
;; respan also can be attached permanently to a group or term, in which
;; case it's attached to the `group` identier, etc., instead of the
;; wrapping parentheses.
;;
;; "Respan" is also used on S-expressions that are not shrubbery
;; representations, because we don't always know what kind of
;; S-expression we have when an syntax error is being formatted. In
;; that case, shrubbery forms are extracted based on good guesses
;; about which things are shrubbery forms, and then respan is applied
;; to the sequence.
;;
;; For most calls to `raise-syntax-error`, `respan` is applied
;; automatically to the arguments. When `raise-syntax-error` is called
;; in a trampolining macro, though, like the way `for` and `class` are
;; implemented, then explicit `respan` may be needed. In those cases,
;; `respan` may also be needed for input to `syntax-parse`, in case it
;; is responsible for raising an exception when a match files.
;;
;; "Relocate" means to take source location from one syntax object and
;; use it for another. The target of a relocation is normally a
;; Racket-level expression or a single term, since relocating a group
;; or term/group sequence is fragile. Note, however, that
;; `Syntax.relocate` works on a group syntax object, especially to
;; transfer prefix and suffix information from one group to another
;; for especially careful transfers (e.g., as in the `rhombus` macro
;; in Scribble to preserve source formatting).
;;
;; "Reraw" means to take the printed form of a syntax object and
;; attach it as the opaque raw form of another syntax object. An
;; opaque raw property means that raw-text information of nested
;; syntax objects is ignored. Note that opaque-raw information is
;; *not* preserved by default, unlike raw information. The target of a
;; reraw operation should be a Racket expression or an individual term,
;; so there's a clear place to attach and so the information does not
;; get lost.
;;
;; When a primitive expression form expands to a parsed term, it
;; should `relocate+reraw` the result using a `respan` of the input
;; shrubbery. Note that `wrap-static-info` and `wrap-static-info*`
;; propagate a relocation+reraw from the wrapped expression to the
;; wrapper, so prefer to add the relocation+reraw inside, and that
;; works for both the wrapped and unwrapped forms.
