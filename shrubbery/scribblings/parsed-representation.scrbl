@title(~tag: "parsed-rep"){Parsed Representation}

The parse of a shrubbery can be represented by an S-expression:

@itemlist(

 @item{Each group is represented as a list that starts @litchar{'group}, and
   the rest of the list are the elements of the group.}

 @item{Atom elements are represented as “themselves” within a group,
   including identifers a symbols, except that an operator is
   represented as a 2-element list that is @litchar{'op} followed by the operator name
   as a symbol.}

 @item{A group sequence is represented as a list of @litchar{'group} lists.}

 @item{An element created by @parens is represented by @litchar{'parens} consed
   onto a group-sequence list.}
   
 @item{An element created by @brackets is represented by @litchar{'brackets} consed
   onto a group-sequence list.}

 @item{An element created by @braces is represented by @litchar{'braces} consed
   onto a group-sequence list.}

 @item{An element created by @quotes is represented by @litchar{'quotes} consed
   onto a group-sequence list.}

 @item{A block is represented as @litchar{'block} consed onto a
   group-sequence list. A @litchar{'block} list appears only at the end of
   a group list or just before an @litchar{'alts} list that is at the end
   of the group list.}

 @item{A sequence of alternatives is represented as @litchar{'alts}
   consed onto a list of @litchar{'block} lists, where each
   @litchar{'block} list represents a @litchar{|} alternative. An
   @litchar{'alts} list appears only at the end of a group list.}

)

Note that there is no possibility of confusion between
symbol atoms in the input and @litchar{'group}, @litchar{'block}, etc., at the start
of a list in an S-expression representation, because symbol atoms will
always appear as non-initial items in a @litchar{'group} list.

Overall, the grammar of S-expression representations is as follows:

@nested(~style: #'inset, shrubbery_s_expression_grammar)

Here's the same grammar, but expressed using Rhombus constructors:

@nested(~style: #'inset,
        bnf.BNF([@nonterm{document},
                 @rhombus([#'top, #,(@nonterm{group}), ...])],
                [@nonterm{group},
                 @rhombus([#'group, #,(@nonterm{item}), ..., #,(@nonterm{item})]),
                 @rhombus([#'group, #,(@nonterm{item}), ..., #,(@nonterm{block})]),
                 @rhombus([#'group, #,(@nonterm{item}), ..., #,(@nonterm{alts})]),
                 @rhombus([#'group, #,(@nonterm{item}), ..., #,(@nonterm{block}), #,(@nonterm{alts})])],
                [@nonterm{item},
                 @nonterm{atom},
                 @rhombus([#'op, #,(@nonterm{symbol})]),
                 @rhombus([#'parens, #,(@nonterm{group}), ...]),
                 @rhombus([#'brackets, #,(@nonterm{group}), ...]),
                 @rhombus([#'braces, #,(@nonterm{group}), ...]),
                 @rhombus([#'quotes, #,(@nonterm{group}), ...])],
                [@nonterm{block},
                 @rhombus([#'block, #,(@nonterm{group}), ...])],
                [@nonterm{alts},
                 @rhombus([#'alts, #,(@nonterm{block}), ...])]))

Here are some example shrubberies with their S-expression parsed
representations:

@verbatim(~indent: 2){
def pi: 3.14

(group de pi (block (group 3.14)))

def fourth(n: integer):
  def m: n*n
  def v: m*m
  printf("~a^4 = ~a\n", n, v)
  v

(group def
       fourth
       (parens (group n (block (group integer))))
       (block
        (group def m (block (group n (op *) n)))
        (group def v (block (group m (op *) m)))
        (group printf
               (parens (group "\"~a^4 = ~a\\n\"") (group n) (group v)))
        (group v)))

if x = y
| same
| different

(group if x (op =) y (alts (block (group same))
                           (block (group different))))

define fib(n):
  match n
  | 0: 0
  | 1: 1
  | n: fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

(group define
       fib
       (parens (group n))
       (block
        (group match
               n
               (alts
                (block (group 0 (block (group 0))))
                (block (group 1 (block (group 1))))
                (block
                 (group n
                        (block
                         (group fib
                                (parens (group n (op -) 1))
                                (op +)
                                fib
                                (parens (group n (op -) 2))))))))))))
}
